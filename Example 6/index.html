        Typography has been a fundamental part of graphic design since the invention of the printing press, so you’d
        expect it to play a central role in the field of web design. Some have gone as far as to say that web design
        is 95% typography. As such, it is surprising that browsers have only recently allowed us to fully embrace
        typography and typesetting on the Web. This opens up the possibility for us to learn from hundreds of years
        of typographic history, and create richly styled content that is a delight to read.
